								<h2 class="major">Personal Information</h2>

								<p>My student number is s3785167, and you can contact me at s3785167@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
								<p>About me: I’ve lived in Australia all my life, but have moved around between a few cities. I was born in Darwin, then moved to Perth when I was only around 3, then moved to Canberra where I finished primary school + year 7, then moved to Melbourne, where I have finished high school and now started the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My main hobbies/interests are technology, gaming, computers. I also have a cat named Naboo (pictured below).</p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></p>
								<p>My interest in IT mainly started with computers and games. I’ve been playing video games for as long as I can remember, which naturally moved me towards interest in computers, and technology in general. If I had to think of a particular person who sparked my interest in IT, it would probably be my dad, who works in the IT industry, and is probably the reason why I have any interest in technology at all. My previous IT experience is fairly basic. I did attempt to learn some programming online a few years back during high school, but didn’t get very far into that. Other then that, my experience mainly consists of generally using computers and technology, and having some knowledge on computer parts, and a bit of experience building computers.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pcsetup.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Theres a picture of my messy gaming setup!</p>
								<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></p>
									<p>I decided to go to RMIT, mainly because I went to the open day and got a good vibe from it. The campus is nice, buildings are cool, and it’s in a good area of the city. Various other reasons helped make the decision, such as it being easy to get there using public transport, and knowing friends that were also enrolling at RMIT. Plus, it’s got technology in the name, so it must be a pretty good place to study IT, right?</p>
									<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
										<p>From my studies, I’m hoping to get a broad overview of the IT world, with some chances to focus on certain topics I enjoy. Going into this course, I didn’t (and still don’t entirely) know what area of IT I wanted to go into, which subjects I’d enjoy the most, and what my potential career would like in the future. That’s one of the major things I want to take from my time here, a clear idea of what my future could hold, along with the various skills and knowledge required in order to make this future into a reality.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/idealjob1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b> Senior Javascript developer at tech startup Hivehub</b></p>
								<p> Job listing can be found <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38593340">here</a></p>
								<p><b>About the position</b></p>
								<p>The position is a senior development position at tech startup HiveHub, who work with organisations, and develop tools to inform organisations on the software they are using. I chose this job as, from my currently limited experience, programming has been enjoyable, and could see it being a potential career option, the pay is good, and generally the company sounds like an interesting environment. The role involves programming, innovating, working in teams, and generally fleshing out the companies products in various aspects.</p>
								<p><b>Skills, qualifcations, and experience required</b></p>
								<p>There are multiple necessary skills and qualifications for this position, such as Javascript experience (and other related programs), relational database experience using PostgreSQL, experience in “building SPA”, maintaining “customer-facing APIs (specifically GraphQL/OpenAPI), knowledge of web infrastructure, high volume/large scale web application.</p>
									<p>Basically, lots of programs and concepts I have never heard of or don’t know much about. On top of that, ability to work in a group, and experience working in “agile environments”. </p>
									<p><b>My current skills and qualifcations</b><p>
										<p>The current relevant experience I have is fairly minimal, and most of it has come from my couple weeks here at RMIT. I have minor experience in programming using Java (but not JavaScript, which is what the listing asks for), I am also learning about Relational databases (which the listing asks for experience in), but would still say I have very little experience with them. Being able to work as a part of a team is one aspect I have actually done, from high school, but still something I need some more experience in for the sake of this job.</p>
										<p><b>How I will obtain the necessary skills</b></p>
										<p>The simplest answer is continuing my course will get me some of the skills and experience required for this job. Experience in relational databases will come from my database concepts class, programming experience will come from my intro to programming class, and other skills and concepts will be learnt and developed on over the next 3 years that I’ll be taking this course for. While I may not necessarily gain experience with all the programs and fields required for this
											 listing, I will at least have the competency to try these programs out, and can always access other resources online to learn programs. In the meantime, my current plan would be to research some of these requirements and programs further, to at least get a basic idea on them for now.</p>

								<p><b>Three online tests taken:</b></p>
								<p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">Myer-Briggs Personality test</a> results:</p>
								<p>Personality type: Defender (ISFJ-A)</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/myer-briggs.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Learning style test</a> results:</p>
								<p><b>Auditory: 35%</b></p>
								<p><b>Visual: 45%</b></p>
								<p><b>Tactile: 20%</b></p>
								<p><a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/ ">Big five personality test</a> results:</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bigfive.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
								<p>I do generally agree with a lot of the results. The defender personality from the Myer-Briggs test seems to fairly suit me, as someone who is somewhat quiet and reserved but still willing to speak up when required, and someone who is generally quite kind and agreeable, and willing to listen to others. I don’t think I fit absolutely everything it says about this personality, such as being a “true altruist” or always going “above and beyond” . The learning style test seems somewhat accurate to me, claiming I’m a visual learner first, auditory second and tactile third. However, breaking down “visual learning” I’d say I’m more visual in the sense of reading, rather than learning through images. The big five personality test makes sense to me, with Emotional Stability, agreeableness and conscientiousness being fairly high, and extroversion + intellect/imagination being the lowest scorers. I definitely am not an “extrovert” so I agree with that scoring low, and I’d say I don’t have the most active imagination, so that also makes sense to be so low. At the end of the day, I think these tests are interesting and do a decent job at representing me, but they do not necessarily account for all individual differences a person has.</p>
								<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</b></p>
								<p>I’d say these results, particularly from the two personality tests, say that I’d be one of the quieter members of the team, but one that is still reliable, can get the work done, and can negotiate or help resolve certain issues in the group when necessary. I’d be someone who is cooperative, and accepting of ideas. I’d try not to upset anyone else in the team, and avoid conflict. However I’d have weaknesses, such as not being the most vocal, not being the most imaginative or creative in terms of ideas, and I certainly wouldn’t be a leader.</p>
								<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team</b></p>
								<p>When forming a team it would be wise to account for people’s individual strengths and weaknesses. For example, having a team where everyone has the same personality as mine wouldn’t work, as the group may end up with no leader, or no creative thinkers to come up with great ideas. Therefore, it would be wise to choose different people with different roles. Assign a leader who is naturally good at leading based on their personality (as well as other factors, such as past experience, as these personality tests aren’t the be all end all).</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<p><b>My project - a fitness tracking collar for cats</b></p>
								<p>My idea for an IT project is a fitness monitor for cats (it could also work for dogs or other pets), which would come in the form of some kind of collar with step tracking features. It would then sync with an app that would provide information to cat owners on how much exercise their cat has (or hasn’t) gotten over the course of a day. This information would be automatically organized into graphs and tables that can show day-by-day comparison of how much the cat has moved around, and whether they are meeting recommended amounts of exercise every day.</p>
								<p>It is a well known fact that cats spend a lot of their time being lazy, with many cats spending the majority of their day either sleeping or lounging around. This is becoming an increasing problem as many cat owners now keep exclusively indoor cats. But with a surge of indoor cats, comes a surge of laziness, and cats not getting as much exercise as they need. This fitness monitor will allow owners the opportunity to find out whether their cat is exercise-deprived, and with this knowledge, owners, particularly owners of indoor cats, can take measures to increase their cat’s exercise, such as giving it new toys to play with. </p>
								<p>The product comes with both hardware and software elements. The hardware is a collar to be worn by cats. It might function and look like similar fitness wearables for humans, such as Fitbits. It would function as a pedometer, that measures the steps a cat takes through motion, and possibly a basic GPS to measure distance travelled over the course of a day (this may also provide the handy feature of being able to locate a cat if it goes missing). This information would then be transmitted to the software side of the product; the companion app, available on mobile devices, or, users can sign in to the website through a browser. Owners can then access the data, and see how much exercise their cat is getting, in terms of steps taken every day. This data would be neatly organized intro graphs and tables so owners can compare the information across days, weeks, or months, and see if there is a trend in their cat’s exercise. Owners can set daily goals for their cats to meet, or use suggested goals based on how much exercise a cat is recommended to get every day. The app could also provide suggestions on how to get cats exercising more, differing depending on whether the cat is an indoor cat or outdoor cat (the blame isn’t entirely on the cat, it’s also the owners obligation to get their cat exercising!).  </p>
								<p>If GPS functionality was included, it could even show a map of where your cat has travelled, and even track their location at any time – obviously this feature would be more targeted towards outdoor cat owners than indoor cat owners. Another potential feature could be social integration – users could add fellow cat owners and compare statistics between them. This may actually motivate cat owners to get their cats exercising even more, if they see their friend’s cats exercising harder than their own.  </p>
								<p>However, the ultimate endgame of this product is super top secret. Hidden in the terms of service, users will agree to have their cat’s data monitored and collected. The data collected will be on the behavior of cats, and can then be sold (at a very high price) to companies in the pet industry, such as creators of cat food, and cat toys. They will then analyse this data and use it for their own nefarious deeds, as I earn money both from users and mega-companies in the pet industry! </p>
								<p>The software elements of my product would need to be programmed, in a language such as Java, and the website could be created using HTML. The collar itself would send it’s data online, to the owner’s account, so the information could be accessed through the app or website. The collar’s hardware should be as minimal as possible, just sending the basic information such as steps/distance moved, and location, and the analysis and organization of the data can be handled online. The design of the collar would ideally need to be fairly lightweight, but still including a pedometer, potentially a GPS if technologically feasible, and a way to transmit this data online. When this product starts to get some attention, maybe I can collaborate with Fitbit for some design tips! </p>
                <p>The skills required to create this product would include programming expertise, to create the app and website. Java could be used to write the app, considering I have no experience in any other programming language, as well as HTML for the website, considering I now have used a very small amount of HTML thanks to this assignment. I don’t think the programming requirements would be too farfetched, especially if working with a team. However, one issue that may arise would be hosting of the servers, website, account system, and all the incoming data that needs to be analysed server side, although I’m sure once our Kickstarter campaign makes triple its funding goal that shouldn’t be a problem at all. The hardware side of things is something I’m less knowledgeable about. Cheap options such as Raspberry Pi’s may not actually be feasible to fit onto a pet collar. To work properly, the technology would probably have to be similar to other fitness watches like the Fitbit, as they are fairly small and lightweight.  </p>
								<p>Overall, if this product were successful, it could potentially reduce overweightness in cats, and get cats across the world being more active. Indoor-only cats could be leading happier and more active lives if their owner’s are making the effort to monitor them and keep them active accordingly. For the product to succeed in this way it does also require owners to take some initiative to get their cats exercising. And of course, if the product were financially successful, it would have the wonderful outcome of making me lots of money! </p>
